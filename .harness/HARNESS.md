# Harness — reconcile 5th round of parallel formal-verification subagents for the meteroid-proof-core crate only (not the full meteroid workspace, which has unrelated unbuildable crates like common-grpc requiring protoc): backfill missing register.toml rows for pending_balance_transaction_idle and reconciliation_amount_gap cores, run 'cargo test -p meteroid-proof-core --quiet' to verify, run 'lake build' in proof/ to verify Lean, commit, push (non-force only), and clean up stale git worktrees already fully reconciled into main
